Revenue & Product Performance Dashboard

![Dashboard Preview](./dashboard_preview.png)

Overview

This project is an interactive analytics dashboard designed to analyze revenue, monetization, product performance, and user retention over time.
The dashboard supports exploratory analysis and decision-making through dynamic filters, actions, and cohort-based insights.

It is built to answer key business questions:
	•	What drives revenue changes month-over-month?
	•	Which locations and products contribute most to growth or decline?
	•	Are revenue changes driven by user volume or monetization?
	•	How does product performance relate to user retention?
